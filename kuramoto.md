title: Kuramoto model

The Kuramoto model ia a mean-field limit of oscillators, which is used
to understand synchronisation behaviours. It is attractive, because it
is mathematical tractable and captures many observed phenomena.  I
have developed an [interactive introduction][kuramoto-intro].

Mathematically, I focus on understanding the Landau damping like
behaviour in this model.
