  Making of a first website.

Finally, I started making my webpage, which is far from complete yet
and in particular it could have a nicer CSS styling. Likewise, it
contains very little content at the moment. Hopefully, over time it
will grow and become nicer.

For making the website, I found the very interesting
[site-generator](http://alex-charlton.com/projects/site-generator/)
project. It allows you to write the texts in your favourite editor in
various formats (which can change freely) and putting everything
together. Including equations is also very easy due to
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).
