title: "Gradient flow on finite state Markov chains"
summary: >
  Result of my long CCA miniproject at the beginning of my PhD program.
---

During my long CCA project with James Norris I looked into gradient
flows on finite state Markov chains.

For the
[Bath Spring School, 12-16 May
2014,](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/j.a.canizo/Bath2014/)
I have created a
[poster]({{ "/static/bath-poster.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
illustrating the result.

A small note is on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2552).
