  Showing some interactive introduction to the Kuramoto model.

I have spent a lot of my time studying the Kuramoto model of
oscillators, which is an intuitive and tractable model to study
synchronisation phenomena.

In order to present it, I think it is very helpful to play around with
the evolution. For this I created a simple webpage, which runs the
model in the browser using Javascript:

[Animation of the Kuramoto model]({{ "/static/kuramoto-animation/kuramoto.html" | prepend : site.baseurl }})

Once you loaded the page, everything is done in your browser and no
Internet connection is needed. In particular, you can just save the
page and use it without any connection.

Please note, that the numerical code seems to give the correct
behaviour, but it has not been thoroughly tested! Moreover, it has
only been tested using recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.

I am looking forward to any comments!
