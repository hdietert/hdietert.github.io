I am a researcher at the CNRS in Paris. Before that I was a postdoc
under [David Gérard-Varet][dgv] and [Laurent Desvillettes][ld] and I
obtained my PhD under the supervision of [Clément Mouhot][cm] and
[Arieh Iserles][ai].

Currently, I am on leave from the CNRS and are visiting professor at
the [institute of mathematics of the University of
Leipzig][https://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/].

Publications are listed under the [publication page][pub].
