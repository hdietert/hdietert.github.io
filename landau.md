title: Landau damping
permalink: /landau

In 1946 Landau published his famous paper for the damping in the
Vlasov equation. The Vlasov equation is a mean-field limit for the
evolution of a plasma without any dissipation and following classical
mechanics is time-reversible. Nevertheless, Landau predicted the
damping of the electric field.

My [Part III essay][part-3] reviewed the linear theory and my
[PhD thesis][doi-phd] gives an introduction focusing on the Volterra
equation of the macroscopic quantities.

Finally, a lot of my work is about this behaviour in the [Kuramoto
model][kuramoto].
