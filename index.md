Welcome at my personal homepage. I am a Mathematician working on PDEs,
which are motivated by physics and biology.

My main focus are equations from kinetic theory and fluid dynamics. In
kinetic theory, I am interested by the emergence of stability by the
mixing of a transport operator (Landau damping) and the interaction
with dissipation operators that are degenerate. A similar interplay
can be found in fluid dynamics known as inviscid damping and enhanced
dissipation. A fascinating interplay between the transport and
diffusion can be observed for boundary layers where the interplay
between the transport and (degenerate) diffusion leads to instability
and ill-posedness.

Recently, I also started to work on cross-diffusion models which can
share the entropy structure of kinetic theory. In such models, the
possible instability by diffusion is well-known as Turing instability.

If you are curious about oscillators and synchronisation, I invite you
to play with my
