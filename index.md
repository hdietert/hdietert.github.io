Welcome at my personal homepage. I am a Mathematician working on PDEs
from physics.

I mostly work on evolution equation from kinetic theory and fluid
dynamics. One focus of my work has been the Landau damping in the
Kuramoto model.

If you are curious about oscillators and synchronisation, I invite you
to play with my
